### Built-in Data Types

- [Built-in Data Types](https://realpython.com/python-first-steps/#built-in-data-types)

- Python has a handful of **built-in data types**, such as  
  - [numbers](https://realpython.com/python-numbers/) (integers, floats, and complex numbers),
  - [Booleans](https://realpython.com/python-boolean/),
  - [strings](https://realpython.com/python-strings/),
  - [bytes](https://realpython.com/python-bytes/),
  - [lists](https://realpython.com/python-list/),
  - [tuples](https://realpython.com/python-tuple/),
  - [dictionaries](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/), and
  - [sets](https://realpython.com/python-sets/).

- You can **manipulate** the *built-in data types* using different tools.  
  … Here are some of them:
  - [Operators](https://realpython.com/python-operators-expressions/)
  - [Built-in functions](https://realpython.com/python-built-in-functions/)
  - [Methods](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/)

#### Numbers

- [Numbers](https://realpython.com/python-first-steps/#numbers)

  ``` Python
  >>> # Addition
  ... 5 + 3
  8
  >>> # Subtraction
  ... 5 - 3
  2
  >>> # Multiplication
  ... 5 * 3
  15
  >>> # True division
  ... 5 / 3
  1.6666666666666667
  >>> # Floor division
  ... 5 // 3
  1
  >>> # Modulus (returns the remainder from division)
  ... 5 % 3
  2
  >>> # Power
  ... 5 ** 3
  125
  ```

  ``` Python
  >>> # The built-in function 'float()' returns floating-point number
  ... float(42)
  42.0
  >>> float(42.5)
  42.5
  >>> sum = float(42.5) + 42.5
  >>> type(sum)
  <class 'float'>
  >>> sum
  85.0
  >>> float("42.5")
  42.5
  ```

  ``` Python
  >>> # The built-in function 'complex()' returns complex numbers
  ... c1 = complex(1,2)
  >>> type(c1)
  <class 'complex'>
  >>> c1
  (1+2j)
  >>> c2 = complex(2,4)
  >>> c1 + c2
  (3+6j)  
  ```

  ``` Python
  >>> # The built in function 'int()' returns integer numbers
  ... i1 = int(42)
  >>> type(i1)
  <class 'int'>
  >>> i1
  42
  >>> int("42") + int(42) + 42
  126
  ```

#### Booleans

- [Booleans](https://realpython.com/python-first-steps/#booleans)

  ``` Python
  >>> # The built-in 'bool()' function returns 'True' or 'False' a
  ... bool(0)
  False
  >>> bool('')
  False
  >>> bool(' ')
  True
  >>> bool('a')
  True
  >>> bool([])
  False
  >>> bool([1, 2])
  True
  ```  

  The [`bool()']() function takes an *object* as an argument  
  … and returns`True` or `False`  
  … according to the object's truth testing rules.

  > By default, an object is considered *true* unless its class defines  
  … either a `__bool__()` method that returns `False`  
  … or a `__len__()` method that returns *zero*,  
  … when called with the object.
  >
  > Here are most of the built-in objects considered *false*:
  >
  > - constants defined to be *false*: `None` and `False`
  > - *zero* of any *numeric type*: `0`, `0.0`, `0j`, `Decimal(0)`, `Fraction(0, 1)`
  > - *empty* sequences and collections: `''`, `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `set()`, `range(0)`

### Strings

- see [Strings and Character Data in Python](https://realpython.com/python-strings/)

- Strings are pieces of text or *[sequences](https://realpython.com/ref/glossary/sequence/) (collection of ordered objects, where each object has an associated integer index) of characters* that you can define using single, double, or triple quotes

  As with other *sequences*, you can **retrieve individual** characters from a string using their **index**.  
  
  An *index* is a [**zero-based integer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering) associated with the **position** of a value in a sequence:

  ``` Python
  >>> welcome = "Welcome John Doe"
  >>> welcome[1]
  'e'
  >>> welcome[-2]
  'o'
  >>> welcome[8:12] # slice
  'John'
  >>> welcome[8:12:2] # slice
  'Jh'  
  ```  

  The syntax (`welcome[-2]`) runs an [*indexing operation*](https://realpython.com/ref/glossary/indexing/)  
  … that *retrieves the character* at the position indicated by the *target index*.
  
  Note that a **negative** *index* retrieves the element in **reverse order**,  
  … with `-1` being the index of the **last** character in the string.

  You can also retrieve a **part** of a string by [**slicing**](https://realpython.com/ref/glossary/slicing/) it.  
  … *Slicing* operations follow the syntax **`[start:end:step]`**.  
  … Here, `start` is the index of the *first value to **include*** in the slice,  
  … and `end` is the index of the *last value, which **isn’t included*** in the returned slice.

  Finally, `step` is an *optional* integer representing the number of values **to jump over**  
  … while extracting the values from the original string.  
  … A step of `2`, for example, will return *every other* (*jedes zweite*) element between `start` and `stop`.

- You can also use a **backslash (`\`) to escape characters** with special meaning, such as the *quotes* themselves.

- The plus operator (**`+`**) **concatenates** strings into a single string.  
  … You should consider using the **`.join()`** method, which is *more efficient*.

  see [How to Join Strings in Python](https://realpython.com/python-join-string/)

- Python’s **f-strings** are an improved string **formatting** syntax.  
  … They’re string literals with an **`f`** at the beginning, *outside the quotes*.  
  … Expressions that appear in **embedded curly braces (`{}`)**  
  … are **replaced with their values** in the formatted string.

  see [Python's F-String for String Interpolation and Formatting](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/)

## Loops

- see [Loops](https://realpython.com/python-first-steps/#loops)

### `for` Loops

- Python’s `for` loops are designed  
  … to **iterate over the items in a collection**,  
  … such as *lists*, *tuples*, *strings*, and *dictionaries*.
  
- see [Python for Loops: The Pythonic Way](https://realpython.com/python-for-loop/)

- Syntax

  ``` Python
  for loop_var in iterable:
      # Repeat this code block until iterable is exhausted
      # Do something with loop_var...
      if break_condition:
          break  # Leave the loop
      if continue_condition:
          continue  # Resume the loop without running the remaining code
      # Remaining code...
  else:
      # Run this code block if no break statement is run
  ```

  You commonly use an **`else` clause** in *loops*  
  … that include *at least one* [**break statement**](https://realpython.com/python-break/) in their code block.  
  … Otherwise, there’s no need for it.

- Example
  
  ``` Python
  # 01.real-python/py_01_for_loop_demo.py
  def do_for_loop(iterable):
    for loop_var in iterable:
      upper = loop_var.upper()
      if upper == 'STOP':
        break
      if upper == 'CONT':
        continue
      print(upper)
    else:
      print('no break occured')
  ```

- REPL
  
  ``` Python
  # …/__learn-python-02-blogs/01.real-python> python3
  >>> import importlib
  >>> import py_01_for_loop_demo as demo  
  >>> demo.do_for_loop(['aaa', 'bbb', 'cont', 'stop', 'ccc'])
  AAA
  BBB
  >>> demo.do_for_loop(['aaa', 'bbb', 'cont', 'ccc'])
  AAA
  BBB
  CCC
  no break occured
  >>> demo.do_for_loop([])
  no break occured  
  ```

### `while` Loops

- In contrast, `while` loops are useful  
  … when you need **to execute a block of code repeatedly**  
  … as long as a given condition remains true.

- see [Python while Loops: Repeating Tasks Conditionally](https://realpython.com/python-while-loop/)

- You typically use a **`while`** loop when you **don’t know beforehand how many iterations you need**  
  … to complete a given operation.

- Syntax

  ``` Python
  while condition:
      # Repeat this code block as long as the condition is true
      # Do something...
      if break_condition:
          break  # Leave the loop
      if continue_condition:
          continue  # Resume the loop without running the remaining code
      # Remaining code...
  else:
      # Run this code block if no break statement is run
  ```

- Example

  ``` Python
  def do_while_loop(iterable):
    count = 1
    while count <= len(iterable):
      upper = iterable[count - 1].upper()
      count += 1
      if upper == 'STOP':
        break
      if upper == 'CONT':
        continue
      print(upper)
    else:
      print('no break occured')
  ```

- REPL
  
  ``` Python
  # …/__learn-python-02-blogs/01.real-python> python3
  >>> import importlib
  >>> import py_02_while_loop_demo as demo
  >>> demo.do_while_loop(['aaa', 'bbb', 'cont', 'ccc'])
  AAA
  BBB
  CCC

  ```

- Note: Python **doesn’t have a `do-while loop`**.  
  … However, you can emulate this type of loop using a `while`.  
  … Check out [How Can You Emulate Do-While Loops in Python?](https://realpython.com/python-do-while/) to learn more.

- There are situations where you need an **infinite loop**.  
  … For example, *GUI applications* run in an *infinite loop*  
  … that manages the *user’s events*.
  
  This loop **needs a *break* statement** to terminate the loop  
  … when, for example, the user exits the application.  
  … You often create this type of [intentionally infinite loop](https://realpython.com/python-while-loop/#intentional-infinite-loops) using the **`while True:`** pattern.
